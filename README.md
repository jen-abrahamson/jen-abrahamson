### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Jenna, and I'm a Geospatial Analytics Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University where I study remote sensing, data fusion, and machine learning. My research and academic work ranges from change detection, image classification, to hydrologic/greenhouse gas modeling, and beyond. 

Some of the things I have been working on:

- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working on building a **Data Fusion Algorithm** for fusing massive non-Gaussian (binary) remote sensing maps.
- ðŸŒŠ Also working on multiple **Machine Learning** models for mapping inundation in wetland ecosystems.
- ðŸ›° Previous research in **Change Detection** at scale for intelligence monitoring operations.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **R** and **Python** for geospatial and remote sensing!
